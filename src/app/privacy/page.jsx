          Excruciatingly Lengthy and Ostentatiously Pompous Data Retention
          Policy
        </p>
        <br />
        Greetings, dear esteemed users, Welcome to our humble abode, where
        seismic aficionados and tidal chatterers unite! Before you dive into the
        exhilarating world of commenting on earthquakes and tsunamis, we implore
        you to partake in the sacred ritual of perusing our data retention
        policy. Brace yourselves, for you're about to embark on a journey
        through the labyrinth of legalese, spiced with a dash of sarcasm, and
        liberally garnished with quirkiness!
        <br />

        <ol className="list-decimal">
          <li>
            By simply gracing your eyeballs upon this majestic document, you
            hereby pledge your undying allegiance to our seismic sanctum.
            Congratulations, dear user! You are now legally bound to us, body
            and soul. Resistance is futile.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data, the nectar of the digital deities, shall be retained with the
            utmost reverence. Every click, every keystroke, every witty comment
            - cherished and immortalized for eternity. Fear not, for your
            digital footprints shall dance merrily in our vast data lake.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the illustrious halls of our repository, data is king. Thus, we
            shall retain your seismic musings for a period that rivals the age
            of the dinosaurs. Behold, the grandeur of our retention period:
            Earthquake Comments: Shall be preserved until the last tremor
            shudders through the Earth's crust, or until the advent of flying
            cars, whichever comes first. Tsunami Tidings: Kept safe and sound
            until the mighty waves recede, or until humans perfect the art of
            underwater basket weaving.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ah, but what of your privacy, you may ask? Fear not, for we guard
            your personal information as fiercely as a dragon hoards its gold.
            Rest assured, your data shall be treated with the same reverence as
            the Queen's (May she rest in peace and glory) corgis.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the unlikely event of a cataclysmic data breach, fear not, dear
            user! Your information shall be scattered to the digital winds, like
            cherry blossoms in a tempest. A poetic tragedy, indeed.
          </li>
          <li>
            As you navigate our hallowed halls, remember this: every pixel,
            every byte, every fleeting thought you share with us becomes our
            eternal property. Your creativity, your innovation, your very
            essence - all belong to us now. Consider it a small price to pay for
            access to our illustrious platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            In conclusion, dear user, we bid you adieu with a heavy heart and a
            lightened data load. May your seismic spectacles be filled with
            wonder, and your digital adventures be as thrilling as a
            rollercoaster ride through the Richter scale.
